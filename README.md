##Metod 1 http redirect

    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=http://example.com/"> 




###Metod 2 server Javascript
Use of meta refresh is discouraged by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Ref: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh. So it is reccomended to use server redirect instead. JavaScript redirects may not work on all the mobile phones as JavaScript might be disabled.
